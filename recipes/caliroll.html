<p>As one of the most popular styles of sushi in Canada and the United States, the California roll has been influential in sushi's global popularity, 
    and in inspiring sushi chefs around the world to create non-traditional fusion cuisine.

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>3 cups sushi rice </li>
    <li>3 1/2 cups water</li>
    <li>1/2 cup rice vinegar</li>
    <li>2 Tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>Roasted Seaweed Sheets</li>
    <li>California Avocado</li> 
    <li>Imitation Crab Sticks</li>
    <li>Persian Cucumbers </li>

</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1: </strong>Cook 3 cups of sushi rice with 3.5 cups of water in a thick bottom pot or rice cooker. 
        Let rice cool down to room temperature (never in the refrigerator).</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Heat rice vinegar with sugar and salt in a stove pot or by using the microwave.
         Heat until sugar and salt are fully dissolved.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Transfer cooled rice to wooden or plastic container. Do not cover. 
        Pour seasoning a little bit at a time over rice and mix with wooden spoon in a cutting motion. 
        Add mixture until rice is glossy and will stick together and tastes to your preference.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Place a layer of rice onto sushi rolling mat, about 1/4" high. Press down, using wet fingers, to get the rice to stick together and be level. 
        Place a seaweed sheet, rough side down, on top of rice.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>Place cucumber sticks in a row, about 1/3 of the way up the mat. 
        Lay crab sticks on top of the cucumbers and then add the California Avocado behind the cucumber & crab.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Grab the edge of the mat closest to you, keeping the fillings in place with your fingers, and roll it into a tight cylinder, using the mat to shape the cylinder. 
        Pull away the mat and set aside. Cover with plastic wrap and place in refrigerator for about 30 minutes.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Repeat until all of the rice has been used. Cut each roll into slices and serve with pickled ginger, wasabi and soy sauce.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 8: </strong>Enjoy!</li>

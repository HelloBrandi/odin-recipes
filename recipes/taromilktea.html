        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Step 1: </strong>Cook the tapioca pearls before you prepare the milk tea. 
                Bring about two cups of water to a boil with a pinch of salt.
             </li>
           
             <li><strong>Step 2: </strong>Add 1/2 cup of dried tapioca pearls and boil for 1-2 minutes until the boba starts to float. 
                Turn off the heat and allow the boba to rehydrate for 10 minutes.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Step 3: </strong>Meanwhile make the simple syrup by heating 1/2 cup of sugar with 1/2 cup of water until the sugar is fully dissolved. 
                You can do this in the microwave or on the stove, whichever is easier. Add the honey and transfer to a bowl or jar. </li>
            
                <li><strong>Step 4: </strong>Drain the tapioca boba and soak them in the honey simple syrup and honey for 1 hour.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Step 5: </strong>When the sweetened boba is ready, make the tea. Bring the water to a temperature of 176°F (80°C) and brew the tea for 5 minutes.
            </li>
            
            <li><strong>Step 6: </strong>Remove the tea leaves from the hot tea. Whisk in the taro powder until fully dissolved. The mixture should be a pale purple color. 
                Note that most taro powder comes sweetened so extra sugar is unnecessary, but feel free to add more to your taste.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Step 7: </strong>Add ice to a cocktail shaker and pour in the taro tea. Shake until combined and at least room temperature. Scoop in some of the boba into two glasses, followed by ice, then divide the taro tea into the two glasses. 
                Top with the half-and-half to complete your taro milk tea. </li>
            
            <li><strong>Step 8: </strong>Enjoy!</li>
